# Nested for loop means one loop runs inside another loop, 
# so the inner loop repeats fully for each outer loop value.

# Task 1: Uncomment the inner loop on line 11, & 12.
# Task 2: Uncomment the line 13 and see the change.
# Task 3: Change the range for outer for loop.

for row in range(1, 6):        # Outer loop controls rows
    print(row)

    #for star in range(0,row):    # Inner loop prints stars
    #   print("*", end=" ")
    #print()
