# The NOT operator reverses a condition’s truth value — 
# it turns true into false and false into true.

# Task : Write a code to check the following on line 17 onwards -
#        1. Create a variable is_raining = True.
#        2. Use the not operator to check if it is not raining.
#        3. If it is not raining → print "You can play outside!"
#        4. Otherwise → print "Take an umbrella!"
