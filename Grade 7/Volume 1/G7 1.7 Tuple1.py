# What is a Tuple?
# A tuple is used to store multiple values in one variable.
# A tuple is written using round brackets( ).

# Indexing in a tuple means accessing individual items from a tuple using their position number.
# Index always starts from 0
#        First item → index 0
#        Second item → index 1

# Task 1: Uncomment line 21 and print the tuple and solve the error.
# Task 2: Create a tuple of names from line 23 onwards.- 
#         1. Print the tuple
#         2. Print the length of the tuple
#         3. Print the second name from the tuple using the index.

num = (11,55,66,33)       # Creating a Tuple.
print(num)                # Print tuple.
print(len(num))           # printing length of a Tuple.
print(num[0])             # Accessing Items using Index - starts from 0.

# num.append(99)          # Tuples cannot be changed. We cannot add or remove items from a tuple.
