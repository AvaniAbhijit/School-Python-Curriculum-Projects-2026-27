# import pygame loads the Pygame library so your Python program can make games with 
# graphics, sound, and controls.

# Task 1: Define screen_width and screen_height variables on lines 14,15, respectively, 
#         and assign the value 800,600, respectively.
# Task 2: After you run the code, try to close the output window by clicking on the cross button.

# Initialize Pygame

# Set up game window
                            # width of the game window
                            # height of the game window

# Set up the game window
