# Conditional statements: Python decides which code to run based on whether a condition is True or False.
# Operators: Symbols used to compare values or combine conditions in Python.

# COMPARISON OPERATORS
# > (Greater than), < (Less than), >=  (Greater than or equal to), <=  (Less than or equal to)
# ==  (Equal to), !=  (Not equal to)

# Task 1: Run the code and check the output.
# Task 2: Uncomment lines 23 & 25. Complete the code on lines 24 to 27.
