# Conditional statements: Python decides which code to run based on whether a condition is True or False.
# Comparison Operators: Symbols used to compare values or combine conditions in Python.
# > (Greater than), < (Less than), >=  (Greater than or equal to), <=  (Less than or equal to)
# ==  (Equal to), !=  (Not equal to)

# Note: Indentation is the spacing at the beginning of a line of code to show structure.

# Task 1: Run the code and check the output. Observe the indentation on lines 16 & 18.
# Task 2: Change the age to 10 on line 14 and run the code to observe the output.
# Task 3: Uncomment lines 22 to 24. Run and see the output.
# Task 4: Uncomment & Complete the code on lines 25-27 to add one more condition.

# Simple if-else condition - This checks if the age is 13 or more
age = 14
if age <= 13:
    print("You can play this game.")      # indented code runs if the condition is True
else:
    print("You are too young to play.")   # indented code runs if the condition is False


# if-elif-else (Multiple conditions) - This checks performance based on score
#score = 75
#if score >= 90:
#    print("Excellent Performance")
#elif_______:                         # Check if score more than 70
                                      # print Good Performance
#else:
                                       # print Need more practice
