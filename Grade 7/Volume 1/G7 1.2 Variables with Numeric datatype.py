# Variables are used to store information in a program.
# The value of a variable can be changed while the program is running.

# Rules of variables :
# 1. Variable name must start with a letter or underscore (_).
#       It cannot start with a number.
# 2. Variable names should not contain spaces.
#       Use underscore (_) instead of space.

# Data type tell Python what kind of value is stored in a variable, such as a number or a decimal.

# Task 1: Run the code and check the error.
# Task 2: Correct the variable name on lines 18 & 20 as per the rule and complete the code on line 19.
# Task 3: Uncomment the code on line 23 and run the code to check the error.
# Task 4: Correct the variable name on line 23 as per the rule and complete the code on lines 24,25.

# 1. Integer (whole numbers)
1age = 12                     # variable that has an integer value.
                              # print variable value.
print(type(1age))             # print variable data type.

# 2. Float (decimal numbers)
#Body weight = 56.5            # variable that has a float value.
                              # print variable value.
                              # print variable data type.
