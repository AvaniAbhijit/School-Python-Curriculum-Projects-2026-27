# Variables are used to store information in a program.
# The value of a variable can be changed while the program is running.
# Data types tell Python what kind of value is stored in a variable, such as a number,
# text, or True/False.


# Task 1: Run the code and check the output.
# Task 2: Change the values of the variables.
# Task 3: Create one new variable of your choice and print it.

name = "Aarav"
age = 13

print(name)
print(age)


# 1. String (text data)
school = "Green Valley School"
print(school)


# 2. Integer (whole numbers)
marks = 85
print(marks)


# 3. Float (decimal numbers)
height = 5.6
print(height)


# 4. Boolean (True or False)
is_student = True
print(is_student)

print(a + b)   # Addition
print(a - b)   # Subtraction
print(a * b)   # Multiplication
