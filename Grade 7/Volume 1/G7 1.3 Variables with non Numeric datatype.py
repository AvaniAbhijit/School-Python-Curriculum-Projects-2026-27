# Rules of variables :
# 3. Variable names are case-sensitive.
#       Age and age are treated as different variables.
# 4. Numbers and special symbols are not allowed in variable names.
#       Only letters, numbers (not at start), and underscore (_) are allowed.

# Data types tell Python what kind of value is stored in a variable, such as text, or True/False.


# Task 1: Correct the variable name on lines 14,15 and 19 as per the variable rule.
# Task 2: Complete the code on lines 16,20 and 21.

# 1. String (text data)
Name = "Green Valley School" # school is a variable here, and "Green Valley School" is a value.
print(name)                  # print variable value.
                             # print variable data type.

# 2. Boolean (True or False)
$condtion = True             # variable that has an integer value.
                              # print variable value.
                              # print variable data type.
