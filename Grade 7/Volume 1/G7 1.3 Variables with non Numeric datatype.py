# Rules of variables :
# 3. Variable names are case-sensitive.
#       Age and age are treated as different variables.
# 4. Numbers and special symbols are not allowed in variable names.
#       Only letters, numbers (not at start), and underscore (_) are allowed.

# Data type tells Python what kind of value is stored in a variable, such as text, or True/False.

# Task 1: Run the code and check the error.
# Task 2: Correct the variable name on lines 15 or 16 as per the rule and complete the code on line 17.
# Task 3: Uncomment the code on line 20 and run the code to check the error.
# Task 4: Correct the variable name on line 20 as per the rule and complete the code on lines 21,22.

# 1. String (text data)
Name = "Green Valley School" # school is a variable here, and "Green Valley School" is a value.
print(name)                  # print variable value.
                             # print variable data type.

# 2. Boolean (True or False)
#$condtion = True             # variable that has an integer value.
                              # print variable value.
                              # print variable data type.
