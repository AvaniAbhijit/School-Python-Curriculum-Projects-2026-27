# Operators are symbols used to perform operations on values.
# They help us compare values and make decisions in a program.

# Types of Operators covered here:
# 1. Relational Operators (< (Less than) , > (Greater than))

# Task 1: Run the code and check the output
# Task 2: Write the code to check if 121 is greater than 200 or not on line 14 onwards. 

# Relational Operators example.
print(5 < 10)   # True
print(8 > 15)   # False
