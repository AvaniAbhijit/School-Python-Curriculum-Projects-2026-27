# Operators are symbols used to perform operations on values.
# They help us compare values and make decisions in a program.

# Types of Operators covered here:
# 2. Logical Operators (and, or)


# Task 1: Age Checker - A child can join the club if their age is between 10 and 15.
#         Write code to check the condition.
# Task 2: Weather Decision - We go outside if: it is sunny OR the temperature is greater than 25.

# Logical Operators
# and operator - Returns True if BOTH conditions are True
age = 12
print(age > 10 and age < 15)   # True

# or operator - Returns True if ANY ONE condition is True
marks = 35
print(marks > 90 or marks > 30)   # True
