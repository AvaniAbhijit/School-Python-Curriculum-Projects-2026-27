# What are variables?
# Variables are used to store information in a program.
# The value of a variable can be changed while the program is running.

# Rules of variables :
# 1. Variable name must start with a letter or underscore (_).
#       It cannot start with a number.
# 2. Variable names should not contain spaces.
#       Use underscore (_) instead of space.
# 3. Variable names are case-sensitive.
#       Age and age are treated as different variables.
# 4. Numbers and special symbols are not allowed in variable names.
#       Only letters, numbers (not at start), and underscore (_) are allowed.

# Variable names should be meaningful. This helps us understand what data is stored in the variable.

# Task 1: Run the code and check the output. Change the values of the variables.
# Task 2: Uncomment lines 26 & 27 and run the code, fix the error.
