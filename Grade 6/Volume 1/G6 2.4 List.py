# What is a List?
# A list is used to store multiple values in one variable.
# A list is written using square brackets [ ].

# Task 1: Find and print how many items are in the list using the len function on line 12.
# Task 2: Print the first item of the list using index on line 15. 
#        Hint - The index of the list starts with 0.
# Task 3: Print all items in the list using a for loop from line 18 onwards.

subjects = ["Coding", "Horticulture", "Robotics"]   # Creating a list named subjects.
print(subjects)                                     # Printing list.
                                                    # Print the length of the list

                                                    # Access Items using Index
                                                    # Print the first item of the list


                                                    # Use a for loop to print each item
