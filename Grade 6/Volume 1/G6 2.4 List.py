# What is a List?
# A list is used to store multiple values in one variable.
# A list is written using square brackets [ ].

# Task 2: Find and print how many items are in the list using the len function on line 13.
# Task 3: Print the first item of the list using index on line 14.
# Task 4: Print all items in the list using a for loop from line 17 onwards.

subjects = ["Coding", "Horticulture", "Robotics"]   # Creating a list named subjects.
print(subjects)                                     # Printing list.
                                                    # print the length of the list

                                                    # Access Items using Index
                                                    # print the first item of the list


                                                    # use a for loop to print each item
