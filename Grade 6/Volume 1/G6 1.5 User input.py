# What is User Input?
# User input means taking information from the user while the program is running.
# Python uses the input() function to take input from the user.

# Important Point:
# input() always takes the input as text (string).

# How to convert input:
# int()   → converts input to an integer.
# float() → converts input to a decimal number.

# Task 1: Run the code and print the student_name on line 18.
# Task 2: Write the code to check the type of student_name and the student's age variable on lines 19 and 24.
# Task 3: Uncomment lines 31-33 and fix the error.

# Taking string input
student_name = input("Enter student name: ")



# Taking integer input
student_age = int(input("Enter student age: "))
print(student_age)


# Taking float input
percentage = float(input("Enter percentage: "))
print(percentage)


#number = input("Enter a number: ")
#print(number)
#print(number + 5)
