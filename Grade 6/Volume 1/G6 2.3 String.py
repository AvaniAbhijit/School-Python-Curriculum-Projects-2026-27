# What is a String?
# A string is a group of characters.
# Strings are written inside single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.
# Example: 'Hello', "Python".

# Indexing means accessing a specific character from a string using its position number.
# Index starts from 0 and is used within square brackets [ ].

# Task 1: Complete the code on line 19 using the len() function.
# Task 2: Complete the code on line 20 using the index[].
# Task 3: Print each letter of the word "CODING" using for letter in "CODING" on line 23 onwards.

name = "Riya"            # Storing a string in the name variable.
print(name)              # Printing name variable.
print(len(name))         # Printing length of name using len() function.
print(name[2])           # Printing the third character from the name variable.

text = "Orchid School"
                                 # print the length of text. 
                                 # print the 6th character


                                   # use a loop to print each letter of "CODING."
