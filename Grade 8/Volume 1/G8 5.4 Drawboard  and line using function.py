# On line 40, draw_board() is the function to draw the screen and margin line.
# The function is called inside the game while loop on line 53.
# margin value defined on line no 23.
# screen.fill(BG_COLOR) has been moved from while loop under draw_board function.
# pygame.draw.line is the method in pygame to draw the line on the screen.

# Task 1 : Define the function draw() after draw_board() function.
# Task 2 : Move the code for lines 55 and 56 into the draw() function body.
# Task 3 : Instead of lines 55,56, call the function draw().
