# Variables are used to store information in a program. 
# The value of a variable can be changed while the program is running.
# Data types tell Python what kind of value is stored in a variable, such as a number,
# text, or True/False.


# Task 1: Print the variable value and its type using type(variable_name) on lines 20 and 21.
# Task 2: Change the values of the variables.
# Task 3: Create one new variable of your choice and print it.


# 1. String (text data)
school = "Green Valley School" # school is a variable here, and "Green Valley School" is a value.
                               # print variable value.
                               # print variable data type.

# 2. Integer (whole numbers)
                              # Create a variable that has an integer value.
                              # print variable value.
                              # print variable data type.



# 3. Float (decimal numbers)
height = 5.6
print(height)


# 4. Boolean (True or False)
is_student = True
print(is_student)
