# Variables are used to store information in a program. 
# The value of a variable can be changed while the program is running.

# Rules of variables :
# 1. Variable name must start with a letter or underscore (_).
#       It cannot start with a number.
# 2. Variable names should not contain spaces.
#       Use underscore (_) instead of space.
# 3. Variable names are case-sensitive.
#       Age and age are treated as different variables.
# 4. Numbers and special symbols are not allowed in variable names.
#       Only letters, numbers (not at start), and underscore (_) are allowed.

# Data types tell Python what kind of value is stored in a variable, such as a number,
# text, or True/False.


# Task 1: Print the variable value and its type using type(variable_name).

# 1. String (text data)
school = "Green Valley School" # school is a variable here, and "Green Valley School" is a value.
print(school)                  # print variable value.
print(type(school))            # print variable data type.

# 2. Integer (whole numbers)
                              # Create a variable that has an integer value.
                              # print variable value.
                              # print variable data type.

# 3. Float (decimal numbers)
                              # Create a variable that has an integer value.
                              # print variable value.
                              # print variable data type.

# 4. Boolean (True or False)
                              # Create a variable that has an integer value.
                              # print variable value.
                              # print variable data type.
