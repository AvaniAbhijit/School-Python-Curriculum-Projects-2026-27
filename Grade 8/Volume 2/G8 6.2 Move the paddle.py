# speed - Added another attribute for the paddle class on line 34.
#         This is number of pixels that the paddle will move up or down.
# move() - another method of paddle class on line 40 which moves the paddle.
# pygame.key.get_pressed() - checks which keys are currently being pressed.
# As we need to move paddle only up/down, we need to modify rect.y value only by speed.

#Task : Check for DOWN arrow key and modify the rect.y value accordingly inside
#       the move method on line no 43.
