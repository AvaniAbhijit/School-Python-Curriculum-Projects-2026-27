# What are variables?
# A variable is like a box.We use it to store information.
# We can change what is inside the box anytime.

# Rules of variables :
# 1. Start with a letter or _
#       Correct → age, _score
#       Wrong → 2age

# 2. No spaces
#       Correct → student_marks
#       Wrong → student marks

# 3. Small and capital letters are different
#       Age and age are NOT same.

# 4. No special symbols
#        Correct → score1
#        Wrong → score@

# Task 1: Enter the values for the variable on line 25,28 and 31.
# Task 2: fix the errors.
# Task 3: Create variable on line 35 and print it on line 36.
