# An if condition is used to check a condition.
# If the condition is True, the code inside the if block runs.
# If the condition is False, the code does not run.

# What is Indentation?
# Indentation means giving space before a line to show it belongs inside a block.
# On line 13,14 has a space before the line, hence it belongs to the if block.

# Task 1: Change the value of score to 40 on line 10.

score = 75
if score >= 50:            # Check here 75 is greater than 50.
    print("You Win!")      # This line will execute because the above condition is true.
    print("You unlocked the next level!")

print("Game Over")         # This line will execute always.
