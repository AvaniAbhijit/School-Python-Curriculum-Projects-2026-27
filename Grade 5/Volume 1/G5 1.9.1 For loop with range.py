# What is a for loop?
# A for loop is used when we know how many times we want to repeat.

# What is Indentation?
# Indentation means giving space before a line to show it belongs inside a block.
# Line 11 has a space before it, and hence they belong to the for block.

# Task 1: Write a for loop to print numbers from 10 to 15.

for number in range(1, 6):  # This prints numbers from 1 to 5.(The last number 6 is not included.)
    print(number)
