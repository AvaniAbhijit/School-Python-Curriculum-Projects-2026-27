# input() Always returns string :
# When a user types something, Python stores it as text, even if it looks like a number.

# Task 1: Complete the code from line 10 to 12.

name = input("Enter your name: ")  # input() stores user data as STRING (text)
print("Hello", name)               # The value is stored exactly as typed
print(type(name))                  # Show the type of data stored

                    # Take number input from the user and store in num1 variable.
                    # Take number input from the user and store in num2 variable.
                    # print the sum of num1 and num2
