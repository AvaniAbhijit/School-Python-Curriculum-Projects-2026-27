# Why int() is important
# To do math, we must convert text into numbers.

# Task 1: Complete the code from line 10 to 12.

num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))     # Converting user input into an integer using int().
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
print("Sum:", num1 + num2)                    # Printing sum of two interger numbers.

                                              # Take user input float number1
                                              # Take user input float number2
                                              # Print difference of two float numbers.
