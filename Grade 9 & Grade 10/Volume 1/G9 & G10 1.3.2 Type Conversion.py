# Why int() is important
# To do math, we must convert text into numbers.

# Task 1: Write code to subtract two float numbers from line 12 onwards.


# Convert user input into integer
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

print("Sum:", num1 + num2)         # Now Python performs real addition
