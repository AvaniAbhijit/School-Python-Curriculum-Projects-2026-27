# Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations on numbers.
#           Operator	                     Example
#       + (Addition)	                     5 + 3 → 8
#       -	Subtraction	                     5 - 3 → 2
#       *	Multiplication	                 5 * 3 → 15
#       /	Division	                     10 / 2 → 5.0
#       //	Floor Division (no decimal)	     10 // 3 → 3
#       %	Modulus (remainder)	             10 % 3 → 1
#       **	Power	                         2 ** 3 → 8
